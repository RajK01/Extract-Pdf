# ✨ PDFextract_text ✨

## 📍Description:

In this Project, the pdf I uploaded and a logo to extract pdf. The main aim of this project is to create 
a graphical user interface with Tkinter, manipulate PDF files with PyPDF2 and present the logo of my app with Pillow/PIL.
This is the beta version of PDF Extract, it only extracts text out of user-selected PDF files.
The full version also handles image extraction and exceptions.
